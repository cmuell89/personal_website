On your first day, I was surprised to see you were a black kid my age. I was surprised you had just moved from West Virginia for this job. I didn't know anyone from West Virginia. I hadn't seen my only other black friend for a few years, since college.

You were surprised by all the weird, "health" food around you now, that you had never eaten before. You preferred fast food, because that is all that you had in West Virginia. I didn't understand.

You told me that every black person has an unspoken, inherited language with one another. And no matter where they are, it's the same language. A nod as you pass by one another walking down the street. Or a simple glance as you wait in line at the bank. It's different, I wouldn't understand. And I didn't.

When we went to Europe for the conference, it was your first time out of the country. It was my first time in Europe. You had to get your passport. We took the Eurostar train from London to Paris, and it was your first time in a place where English wasn't the spoken language.

I carried myself with the confidence I knew from home. I'm in control of my life, my situation, the moment. I could nagivate the trains and bus systems. I would get us where we needed to go.

Back in California, you laughed when I didn't understand using the word "chalky" to describe dry skin. You told me every black person uses lotion to keep their skin from getting chalky.

You knew there was a gap between you and your surroundings. I didn't understand it. There is no gap for me.

You attemped suicide at 30.

I am disappointed of my ignorance. I still don't fully understand. I understand I will never truly understand. But what once were shut eyes, have cracked open, just a gap, enough to let light in and dilate the pupil. I'm ready to wake up, and I am so sorry it took this long.
