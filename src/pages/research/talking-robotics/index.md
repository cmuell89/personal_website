I recently gave a virtual seminar presentation on the state of my thesis work. This includes prior work on CC-LfD and ARC-LfD, my current work on constrained motion planning, and future human-subjects studies coming down the pipeline. 

The seminar series, called [Talking Robotics](https://talking-robotics.github.io/), is hosted by a group of students and post-docs, one of whom I met at the AAAI Doctoral Consortium. It is a great opportunity for current students, post-docs, and faculty to continue to advertise their research and network with their peers, especially in light of the COVID19 pandemic.

The landing page for my presentation can be found [HERE](https://talking-robotics.github.io/session_details/carl.html), but be sure to explore all the other great talks on the website!
